# SnakeGame
Welcome to SnakeGame, a classic snake game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

SnakeGame is a simple browser-based game where the player controls a snake. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the walls of the game board. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the player earns points. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the wall.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls using arrow keys.
- Dynamic game board with a responsive design.
- Score tracking with a display of the current score and high score.
- Audio effects for different game events (e.g., eating food, game over).
